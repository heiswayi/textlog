# TextLog v1.0

TextLog is a minimalist, distraction-free and content-focused Jekyll theme with flexible content width. TextLog does not have **about page**, instead TextLog has a quite simple homepage; a brief introduction text (about the blog itself or the author bio) and then goes a list of post titles. Font or typeface used is [Droid Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans) from Google Web Font. Droid Sans is one of the best web fonts with highest readability. TextLog supports [Disqus comment](https://disqus.com/) and [tags](https://heiswayi.github.io/textlog/tagged/).
